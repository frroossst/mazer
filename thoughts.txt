I want to re-write and re-structure this project as now I know a lot more than
when I started this project

I want this to be a scripting language that is feature complete lisp

Write a fast markdown parser that can output HTML

Each component of the lisp DSL will implement a render or display trait in Rust
to ensure the produced MathML is uniform

I also want to have a lot better errors and debug context
