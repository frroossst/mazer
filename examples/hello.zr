It was not discovered by this guy! He was busy making cups?!

let z = (* (dot (

let a = (+ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9);

let b = (* 10 (* a 10));

The answer of b is eval(b).

integral of x^2 from 0 to 10 w.r.t x can be written as
fmt(integral (pow x 2) 0 1 dx)

# This is where the mazer üçÅ magic ‚ú® begins!
