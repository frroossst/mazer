### Quadratic formula

This is **very** important

Italics font is *slanted* 

[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_formula)

It was not discovered by this guy! He was busy making cups?!
![Pythagoras](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.historycollection.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F07%2F38cross-section-of-a-pythagorean-cup.-pintrest.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=747723f73a2e6b2aca85a6433a4b20116cedde41676f964c0012d49c0c960636&ipo=images)

```
x = 123
y = 123
```

// this does not appear in the final document

> Let there be hypotenuse

let decimal = (69.420);
let neg = -456.873;
let x = 123;

eval((+ 1 2))

let y = (integral
    0, ten,
    "x^2", 
    "dx"
);

fmt([0, [1, [2], [3, 4], 5], 6]);

let z = (* (dot (
    (vec 1 2 3)
    (vec 4 5 6)
    )
) 10)


// this is the same as above except the new syntax
// allows binary functions to capture arguments
// from lhs and rhs scope, making some syntax 
// more ergonomic
// let new_syntax0 = vec!(1, 2, 3) dot vec!(4, 5, 6);

This is how inline stuff ${y} would work

let a = (+ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9);
let b = (* 10 (* a 10));

fmt((/ 1 2))

let dvec = vec!(1, 2, 3) dot vec!(4, 5, 6);
let sino = 2 * (sin!(3 / 4));

The answer of b is eval(b).

integral of x^2 from 0 to 10 w.r.t x can be written as

fmt(integral(0, 10, "x^2", "dx")) or fmt(y)

fmt("Hello World!")

fmt("123") // should not parse as a number

# This is where the mazer üçÅ magic ‚ú® begins! 

fmt([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]);

fmt(icap() + jcap() + kcap()) is the same as fmt(icap()) + fmt(jcap()) + fmt(kcap()) 

fmt(icap())     // prints the math
fmt(icap)       // prints the defined value of icap
fmt("icap")     // prints the string "icap"
"fmt("noshow")" // does nothing
