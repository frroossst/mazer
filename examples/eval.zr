let two = 2;
let three = 3;

let power = (pow three two);
let root = (sqrt power);

The answer of three raised to the power of two is eval(power).  
The answer of the square root of power is eval(root).

let x = (matrix 1 2 3);

let y = (matrix 4 5 6);

let ans = (dot x y);

eval(ans)

let a = (+ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9);

let b = (* 10 (* a 10));
let b = (* 10 (* a 10));

The answer of b is eval(b).


let i1 = (integral (pow x 2) 0 1 x);

fmt(i1)
eval(i1)
