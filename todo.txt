-[ ] make sure show fmt can handle arbitrary quote so  I can represent something
    like `f(x)`

-[ ] make sure integrals take in a dx by default dx so it is 
    (integral
        (+
            (pow x 2)
        )
        dx
    )

-[ ] why does (show pi) not do anything  but (show (pi)) shows pi ()


-[ ] add a table fmt directive for pretty tables
